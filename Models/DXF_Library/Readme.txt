This DXF library is made of select images pulled from the internet or generated by hand.
the intent originated as a need for simple to import shapes to use in teaching programming through OpenSCAD during Tinkerfest at Science Works 2013.

DXF files can be generated in Inkscape using images or shapes imported

###Standards:###
Image shape is 150mmx150mm
All images are on their own layer.
the beginning X/Y coordinates are 0,0.



###Creating a DXF file in Inkscape:###
Locate an image from any source.  The simpler the image, the simpler it will be to convert. 
	The easiest to work with images tagged as solouhettes or stencils.
Create a new layer in Inkscape with a title to match the image.  
	Title will be all lower case with no spaces.  a single word is best. i.e. "cat" "star" not "Bunny Rabbit"
Import it into Inkscape by dragging and dropping.
Select "Trace Bitmap" from the "Path" menu
Select the "Edit Paths By Nodes" tool (F2)
Select any nodes you do not wish to keep and press delete to remove them
Select the entire image, and thus all nodes.
Remove the original traced image
	Move the entire selection off of the traced image.
	Select the "Select and Transform" tool.
	Select and delete the original image.
	Return to the node edit tool.
Select the entire image, and thus all nodes.
Click "Insert new nodes in into selected segments. 
	This effects the resolution of your image. 
	Since splines are not supported by OpenSCAD, the line between each node will be straight.  
	More nodes means higher resolution. 
	Keep in mind that a printer can only print so well anyhow before trying to render 10k nodes!
Click "Make Selected Segments Lines" to remove splines.
Move image to X=0, Y=0, 
Resize to X=150, Y=150 (Lock perspective if you wish and size to maximize as required)
Lock layer and turn off visibility to import more images on new layers if desired
